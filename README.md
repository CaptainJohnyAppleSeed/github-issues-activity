# github-issues-activity-F17
Repository for a Hands-On Activity walking though a git/GitHub Workflow

To use:

1. Fork this repo into an organization for the course.
2. Enable issues in the fork.
3. Copy the issues from the original repo to the fork.  Using something 
like [GitHub issues Import|https://github.com/IQAndreas/github-issues-import] makes
this relatively painless.
4. Invite all participants to be collaborators in the organization so that they can be assigned issues.
5. Assign a unique Part 1 issue to each participant. Participants will complete these concurrently, and issue pull requests. All Part 1 tasks are independent so no conflicts should result when merging the pull requests or when they pull before starting Part 2 issues.
6. Assign each Part 2 issue to multiple participants. The instructor will make a concurrent change by copying code from the solution while participants work on these issues. Pull requests will generate merge conflicts. Participants will then pull changes, resolve conflict and reissue pull request.  Instructor can then merge one.
